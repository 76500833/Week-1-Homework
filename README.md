## Description

#### What was your motivation?
- I wanted to get the hang of understanding html and css, so by doing this homework, I was able to spend time doing what I love to do, learning programming.
#### Why did you build this project?
- I changed (most) elements in the HTML starter file so that search engines will be able to suggest it to users. The web prefers these types of programs so that people that use screen readers can understand websites.
#### What problem does it solve?
- When people use screen readers due to some disability(s), they need the computer to translate the html code, so i got rid of the code that dosnt sound like english, and replaced it with code that does: "semantic code". Thus solving the problem of innaccesability to a subset of the population.
#### What did you learn?
- I learned some semantic HTML elements, how to write a README, and got familiar with git.
