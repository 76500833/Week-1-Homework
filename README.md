# Week-1-Homework

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

#### What was your motivation?
- I wanted to get the hang of understanding html and css, so by doing this homework, I was able to spend time doing what I love to do, learning programming.
#### Why did you build this project?
- I changed (most) elements in the HTML starter file so that search engines will be keen on suggesting it to users, and so that people that use screen readers can understand my website.
#### Mainly I did the homework for the contribution to my grade, and as practice.
- What problem does it solve?
#### When people use screen readers due to blindness, they need the computer to translate the html code, so i got rid of the code that dosnt sound like english, and replaced it with code that does
- "semantic code"
#### What did you learn?
- I added a touch more practice time under my belt in order to get more familiar with HTML and CSS, and learned a couple of questions that I want to ask my instructors.
